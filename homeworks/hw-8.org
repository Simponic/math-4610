TODO: Update LIZFCM org file with jacobi solve, format_matrix_into, rand

* Question One
See ~UTEST(jacobi, solve_jacobi)~ in ~test/jacobi.t.c~ and the entry
~Jacobi -> solve_jacobi~ in the LIZFCM API documentation.
* Question Two
A problem arises when using the Jacobi method to solve for the previous population
distribution, $n_k$, from $Ln_{k} = n_{k+1}$, because a Leslie matrix is not diagonally
dominant and will cause a division by zero. Likewise, we cannot factor it into $L$
and $U$ terms and apply back substitution because pivot points are zero.
* Question Three
